What this program does
======================
This project have two parts. sndinfo and sndconv. 

sndinfo
=======
This program shows basic information about given file. They include:

* Filename
* Format (AIFF or CS229)
* Sample Rate
* Bit Depth
* Channels
* Samples
* Duration

Usage:
======
$ ./sndinfo

sndconv
=======
This program takes an input file and an output file, the convert one file format to another. 

Usage:
======
$ ./sndconv


How did I broke files
=====================
utils.c   - Utility functions.
utils.h   - Utility macros. 
aiff.c    - AIFF check and processing unit. 
cs229.c   - CS229 checka and processing unit. 
sound.h   - Defined the soundinfo struct which shares among different units. 
sndinfo.c - The executable file sndinfo, handles I/O and prompts.
sndconv.c - The executable file sndconv, handles I/O and prompts.
Makefile  - The Makefile for the whole project.  

make will first compile dependency to object file then link them together. 

Techniques
==========
* Use fread() and fwrite() for block read/write. 
* Use struct to store sound informations. Passed struct * in function in order to save memory copy overload. 
* Use as many built in functions as possible. Does not re-invent wheels. 
* All code are valgrind warning-free (with --leak-check=full). 
* Developed with Vim, GCC, GNU Make, gdb and tmux.
